  <section name="About the OpenAM Project">
   <p>OpenAM provides open source Authentication, Authorization, Entitlement
   and Federation software. Through OpenAM, the community actively continues
   development of OpenSSO.</p>
   <p>OpenAM provides core identity services to simplify the implementation of
   transparent single sign-on (SSO) as a security component in a network
   infrastructure. OpenAM provides the foundation for integrating diverse
   web applications that might typically operate against a disparate set of
   identity repositories and are hosted on a variety of platforms such as web
   and application servers.</p>
