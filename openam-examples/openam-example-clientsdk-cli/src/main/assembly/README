This README file provides brief instructions on running OpenAM
client sdk samples  that would run in a stand alone JVM, outside of any
container.

1. Unzip the openam-example-clientsdk-cli-${project.version}.zip. You would 
   find a directory samples/sdk. This directory has all that is required to 
   try out OpenAM client sdk samples.

   The directory is laid out as below:
     + sdk
     |- source    (contains source files that require compilation)
     |- scripts   (contains scripts to compile and run samples)
     |- resources (contains resources required to run the samples)
     |- lib       (contains jar files required to use the OpenAM clientsdk)

2. To run the samples:
   -- Run scripts/setup.sh (or setup.bat)  
      This will setup AMConfig.properties to point to the OpenAM server.
      This only need to be run once for all the client SDK samples.
   -- Run individual client SDK samples by executing the shell or bat scripts 
      under "scripts" directory, e.g. scripts/run-xacml-client-sample.sh
      Sample runtime may require additional property files to be correctly set 
      up under resources directory. This would be specifically mentioned in the
      comments included in corresponding scripts.
