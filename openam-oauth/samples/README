This README explains steps to configure and deploy a REST based sample
and secure it using OpenSSO OAuth Token Service. 

%% Contents:
    %% 1. Prerequisites
    %% 2. Deploy and configure OpenSSO
    %% 3. Build and deploy the StockService.war 
    %% 4. Build and run the Stock Client
    
%% 1. Prerequisites
You must have the following software installed and running to be able 
to run the sample:

JDK 6 - http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
GlassFish v2 - https://glassfish.dev.java.net/downloads/v2ur2-b04.html
OpenSSO build 9 - http://opensso.dev.java.net


%% 2. Deploying OpenSSO
Deploy and configure opensso.war using the Glassfish admin console. 


% 3. Build and deploy the sample stock service StockService.war
1. cd StockService; 
2. copy ./web/WEB-INF/web.xml.template to ./web/WEB-INF/web.xml 
   edit ./web/WEB-INF/web.xml
   change the tags <PROTOCOL>, <HOST>, <PORT> and <DEPLOYURI> to the 
   protocol, host(FQDN), and port of glassfish server on which the 
   OpenSSO server is hosted. Save the change.
3. run "ant"
   This command creates a StockService.war under dist directory
4. Deploy StockService.war using Glassfish administration console.


% 4. Build and run the sample stock client StockClient.war
1. cd StockClient
2. copy ./src/com/sun/samples/GetQuote.java.template to 
   ./src/com/sun/samples/GetQuote.java 
   edit ./src/com/sun/samples/GetQuote.java
   change the tags <PROTOCOL>, <HOST>, <PORT>, and <DEPLOYURI> to the 
   protocol, host(FQDN), and port of the glassfish server on which the 
   OpenSSO server is hosted.
   change the tags <PROTOCOL-STOCKSERVICE>, <HOST-STOCKSERVICE>, and 
   <PORT-STOCKSERVICE> to the protocol, host(FQDN), and port of the 
   glassfish server on which the sample stock service is hosted.
   The OpenSSO OAuth implementation supports all three signature
   methods, i.e. HMAC-SHA1, RSA-SHA1, and PLAINTEXT.
   By default, this sample uses HMAC-SHA1. You may test 
   different signature methods from the jsp page.
3. run "ant"
   This command creates a StockClient.war under dist directory
4. Deploy StockClient.war using Glassfish administration console.
5. Access the URL 
   <PROTOCOL-STOCKCLIENT>://<HOST-STOCKCLIENT>:<PORT-STOCKCLIENT>/StockClient
   using a browser (replace the tags <PROTOCOL-STOCKCLIENT>, 
   <HOST-STOCKCLIENT>, and <PORT-STOCKCLIENT> with the protocol, 
   host(FQDN), and port of the glassfish server on which this sample 
   stock client is hosted.)
   A page diplayed with a text field labelled "Stock Symbol", list box 
   labelled "Signature Method", and a button "GetQuote". 
   Enter a valid stock symbol such as JAVA in the text field,
   change the signature method, (if required)
   and click on the GetQuote button.
   The opensso server login page shows and you enter user/password, e.g.
   demo/changeit.
   After authentication is successful, an OAuth Authorization page is
   displayed with the user's uuid and two buttons labelled "Authorize" 
   and "Revoke". 
   After clicking on the Authorize button, the stock quote should be 
   shown in a format similar to the following:
    <QuoteResponse>
    <Company>Sun Microsystems</Company>
    <Symbol>JAVA</Symbol>
    <Time>10/14/2009 4:00pm</Time>
    <Price>
    <Last>9.15</Last>
    <Open>9.15</Open>
    <DayHigh>9.18</DayHigh>
    <DayLow>9.12</DayLow>
    <YearRange>9.12</YearRange>
    </Price>
    <Change>0.00</Change>
    <Volume>0.00</Volume>
    <MarketCap>0.00</MarketCap>
    </QuoteResponse>
