# OpenAM Community Edition 11.0.3

Traditionally delivered as six different products — SSO, adaptive authentication, strong authentication, federation, web services security and fine-grained entitlement enforcement — OpenAM now provides all this in a single, unified cross platform offering deployed as a .war file into a Java Servlet container such as Tomcat.
