/**
 * Responsible for ensuring that the CTS Reaper continues to operate,
 * even under conditions where exceptions are being thrown. The principle of
 * this class depends on the implementation of the ScheduledExecutorService.
 *
 * This code is a little unintuitive, because of the concept that a fixed
 * running task has no logical end point.
 *
 * When the scheduled task fails to execute by throwing an exception the
 * ScheduledExecutorService will re-throw the exception as an
 * ExecutionException for the future. This is what is being monitored by
 * this code, and used as the signal to log the error and re-schedule the
 * CTS Reaper.
