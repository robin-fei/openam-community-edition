OpenSSO - Server based Unit test.

Steps:
 1. Install OpenSSO server
     - deploy the opensso.war and configure it
 2. Setup the test
     - unzip amserver/built/test/dist/opensso-server-test.zip to a directory
       in the same machine where opensso.war is deployed.
 3. Run the test
     - type
       ant -D""bootstrap.dir=<base dir of your OpenSSO Server installation>"
       e.g.
       ant -D"bootstrap.dir=/opensso"
       to run all test suites; or to selectively run individually
       test suite, invoke the specific target in the ant build XML.
