%% 1. Deploying and Configuring the opensso server
Please refer to opensso/products/amserver/war/README

%% 2. Building the agent
Please refer to opensso/products/webagents/docs/<platform>/apache/README.txt.

%% 3. Installing and configuring agent
Installation details are provided at
opensso/products/webagents/docs/<platform>/apache/INSTALL.txt. For this demo,
please follow the following steps in place of the bullet
"1.2.2 Please perform the below tag swapping" in INSTALL.txt.

PRIMARY_NAMING_URL = <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/demo/namingservice
PRIMARY_LOGIN_URL = <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/demo/UI/Login
    where <protocol>, <hostname> and <port> are the demo server's protocol,
    hostname and port respectively.

com.sun.am.policy.am.username = UrlAccessAgent
com.sun.am.policy.am.password = XFC3z18nqMEgWbnshtNfwQ==
    where XFC3z18nqMEgWbnshtNfwQ== is the encrypted password (adminadmin)
    This can be generated by
    opensso/products/dsame/webagents/am/source/crypt_util adminadmin

com.sun.am.policy.agents.config.agenturi.prefix = <agent-protocol>://<agent-hostname>:<agent-port>/amagent
com.sun.am.policy.agents.config.fqdn.default = <agent-hostname>
    where <agent-protocol>, <agent-hostname> and <agent-port> are the agent's
    protocol, hostname and port respectively.

Remember to restart the apache web server after configuring the agent.

%% 4. Creating the user
New user can be created in the user management datastore. Here, you create a
user and later grant him privileges to access all web resources. Please
follow the following steps to create an user.

    %% In the web console, click on the opensso realm hyperlink; and you 
       see the profile of a realm;
    %% Select the Subjects tab to view the realm's subject main page;
    %% Click on the New button to access the user creation page;
    %% Enter an user ID (example duke); password (example opensso); and
       other required fields;
    %% Click on OK button to create the user;
    %% Click on Access Control breadcrumb to go back to the main page.

%% 5. Creating the policies
Here, you create a policy so that the newly created user, "duke"
can access to all web resources that are served out by the apache
server. Please follow the following steps to create this policy.

    %% In the web console, click on the opensso realm hyperlink; and you 
       see the profile of a realm;
    %% Select the Policies tab; and you see the realm's policies main page;
    %% Click on the New Policy button to access the policy creation page;
    %% Enter a name for the policy (example DemoPolicy);
    %% Click on the New ... button under the Rules action table to access
       the rule creation page. (Choose "URL Policy Agent (with resource name)"
       in the "Select Service Type for the Rule" page; and click on the Next
       button)
    %% Enter DemoRule as rule name;
    %% Enter <agent-protocol>://<agent-hostname>:<agent-port>/* as the
       resource name. where <agent-protocol>, <agent-hostname> and
       <agent-port> are the agent's protocol, hostname and port
       respectively;
    %% Check the GET and POST checkboxes and have their values as allow;
    %% Click on Finish button to create the rule;
    %% Click on the New ... button under the Subjects action table to access
       the subject creation page; (Choose "OpenSSO Identity Subject"
       in the "Select Subject Type" page; and click on the Next button)
    %% Enter DemoSubject as subject name;
    %% Select User in the Filter dropdown list and click on Search button;
    %% Select the user Id that was created in step 7. (example duke) under the
       Available list box and click on "Add >" button to select the user;
    %% Click on Finish button to create the subject;
    %% Click on OK button to create the policy.

%% 6. Exercising the access control
This demo is setup so that the user can access all web resource under
<agent-protocol>://<agent-hostname>:<agent-port>.

    %% Log out of the web console;
    %% Open a web browser (with Javascript and cookie enabled), visit
       <agent-protocol>://<agent-hostname>:<agent-port> where
       <agent-protocol>, <agent-hostname> and <agent-port> are the
       protocol, hostname and port number of the agent's web server
       respectively.
    %% You will be redirected to <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/demo/UI/Login,
       the Login page by the web agent as you have not yet authenticated.
       (<protocol>, <hostname> and <port> are the protocol, hostname and port
        number of the opensso server respectively.)
    %% Log in as the newly created user, "duke" with password "opensso";
    %% You will be brought to the URL that you first attempt to visit, i.e.
       <agent-protocol>://<agent-hostname>:<agent-port>.

You can modified the policy to alter his access rights. For instance,
<agent-protocol>://<agent-hostname>:<agent-port>/html/*, so that he can 
only access all web resource under
<agent-protocol>://<agent-hostname>:<agent-port>/html/*

Or you can visit the web console to delete the policy and then the user will
not have access to any resources
<agent-protocol>://<agent-hostname>:<agent-port>

    %% To logout, visit <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/demo/UI/Logout;
    %% Log in to the system by visiting <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/demo;
    %% Enter "amadmin" and "adminadmin" as username and password respectively;
    %% In the web console, click on the opensso realm hyperlink; and you 
       see the profile of a realm;
    %% Select the Policies tab; and you see the realm's policies main page;
    %% Check the checkbox next to the policy to delete;
    %% Click on the Delete button to delete it.

Now, the user will not have access to any resource in
<agent-protocol>://<agent-hostname>:<agent-port>

    %% Log out of the web console;
    %% Clear the browser's cache and cookie.
    %% Open a web browser (with Javascript and cookie enabled), visit
       <agent-protocol>://<agent-hostname>:<agent-port> where
       <agent-protocol>, <agent-hostname> and <agent-port> are the
       protocol, hostname and port number of the agent's web server
       respectively.
    %% You will be redirected to <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/demo/UI/Login,
       the Login page by the web agent as you have not yet authenticated.
       (<protocol>, <hostname> and <port> are the protocol, hostname and port
        number of the opensso server respectively.)
    %% Log in as the newly created user, "duke" with password "opensso";
    %% You will get a denied access message.

%% 7. Alternatives
You can deploy a sample WAR to try out access control policy evaluation.
    %% cd opensso/products/amserver;
    %% ant demo;
    %% a WAR file, openssodemo.war will be created under
       opensso/products/amserver/built/demo/dist directory;
    %% Deploying and Configuring the opensso demo, Please refer to
       opensso/products/amserver/war/README;
    %% Login as amadmin user;
    %% Point your browser to
       <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/opensso/EvaluatePolicy.jsp or
       <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/openssodemo/EvaluatePolicy.jsp,
       depending on where the web application is deployed;
    %% Enter http://www.demo.com in the textbox and click on evaluate button;
    %% We will get a "false" policy decision for this resource.
    %% Point your browser to
       <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/opensso or
       <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/openssodemo, depending on where the web
       application is deployed; and create a policy.
          %% In the web console, click on the opensso realm hyperlink; and you
             see the profile of a realm;
          %% Select the Policies tab; and you see the realm's policies main
             page;
          %% Click on the New Policy button to access the policy creation page;
          %% Enter a name for the policy (example DemoPolicy);
          %% Click on the New ... button under the Rules action table to access
             the rule creation page. (Choose "URL Policy Agent (with resource
             name)" in the "Select Service Type for the Rule" page; and click
             on the Next button)
          %% Enter DemoRule as rule name;
          %% Enter http://www.demo.com as the resource name;
          %% Check the GET and POST checkboxes and have their values as allow;
          %% Click on Finish button to create the rule;
          %% Click on the New ... button under the Subjects action table to
             access the subject creation page; (Choose "Authenticated Users" in
             the "Select Subject Type" page; and click on the Next button)
          %% Enter DemoSubject as subject name;
          %% Click on Finish button to create the subject;
          %% Click on OK button to create the policy.
    %% Point your browser to
       <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/opensso/EvaluatePolicy.jsp or
       <protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/openssodemo/EvaluatePolicy.jsp,
       depending on where the web application is deployed;
    %% Enter http://www.demo.com in the textbox and click on evaluate button;
    %% We will get a "true" policy decision for this resource.

You can try different resource names and subject types to test the policy
evaluation results.
